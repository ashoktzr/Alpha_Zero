Alpha Zero is a rigorous testing framework for evaluating whether technical indicators and market features can consistently identify profitable trading opportunities. Using clustering and forward-scan backtesting, it challenges the myth that technical analysis can predict future price movements.

## 🌿 Branch Information

This repository has two main branches:

- **`streamlit`**: Demo version for trying the app on Streamlit Community Cloud (limited to 50k rows, 60 candle max lookahead, 4 features max)
- **`unlimited`** (recommended): Full-featured version without constraints - use this for serious research and local development

Clone the unlimited branch for maximum flexibility:
```bash
git clone -b unlimited https://github.com/ashoktzr/Alpha_Zero.git
```

For detailed branch differences, see [BRANCHES.md](BRANCHES.md).

## 💡 The Challenge

**Can you find a feature combination that achieves >50% precision with SL/TP > 1?**

Most traders believe technical indicators can predict profitable trades. This tool lets you test that hypothesis using:
- Machine learning clustering (K-Means/HDBSCAN)
- Rigorous historical simulation
- Statistical analysis of win rates

**Spoiler**: With realistic risk/reward ratios, achieving consistent profitability is virtually impossible due to market randomness.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 **Feature Engineering**
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, Stochastic, Williams %R, CCI, ADX
- **Market Structure**: Pivot distances, MA angles, autocorrelation, log returns
- **Configurable Parameters**: Customize all indicator settings

### 🧠 **Clustering**
- **Methods**: K-Means, HDBSCAN
- **Scaling Options**: Standard, MinMax, Robust, Rolling Z-Score, None
- **PCA Visualization**: 2D projection of clusters
- **Unlimited features**: No limit on feature selection (unlimited branch)

### 🔍 **Forward Scan**
- **Dual-direction simulation**: Both long and short analyzed simultaneously
- **Precise TP/SL detection**: Uses high/low prices, not just close
- **Configurable lookahead**: Prevent data leakage
- **Visual verification**: Inspect individual trades

### 📈 **Results Analysis**
- **Cluster metrics**: Precision, coverage, win rate, avg duration
- **Visual pattern recognition**: See if TP/SL outcomes are spatially separated
- **Feedback system**: Report issues or contribute on GitHub

## � Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone unlimited branch
git clone -b unlimited https://github.com/ashoktzr/Alpha_Zero.git
cd Alpha_Zero

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app/gui_streamlit.py
```

### Data Options

**Option 1: Download from Binance (Built-in)**
- Select "Download from Binance" in the app
- Choose symbol, timeframe, days back
- Data fetched automatically

**Option 2: Upload CSV**
- Required columns: `timestamp`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`
- Works best with Binance-format data

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. **Data & Indicators**
Load OHLCV data and compute technical indicators

### 2. **Feature Selection**
Choose features from:
- **Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Stochastic, CCI, ADX, etc.
- **Structure**: Log returns, pivots, MA angles, volume

### 3. **Clustering**
Group similar market conditions using K-Means or HDBSCAN
- **Why scaling?** Prevents feature dominance (volume vs RSI)
- **Visualization**: See if clusters are well-separated

### 4. **Forward Scan**
Simulate trades from each cluster
- **Independent of TP/SL**: Clusters don't know about your targets
- **Verification**: Does TP hit more often than SL within this cluster?

### 5. **Results**
Analyze precision (win rate) for each cluster
- **Goal**: Find features that separate profitable from losing trades
- **Reality check**: Most clusters show random outcomes

---

## 🎯 Understanding the Results

### Cluster Visualization (PCA)
- **Tight, separated clusters** = distinct market conditions
- **Overlapping clusters** = weak feature separation

### Outcome Visualization
- **Green dots** = TP hit first
- **Red dots** = SL hit first
- **Gray dots** = Neither hit
- **Spatial separation** = features working to separate wins from losses
- **Overlapping colors** = random outcomes

### Success Criteria
Find a cluster with:
- **Precision > 50%** (win rate)
- **Coverage ≥ 3%** (enough trades)
- **SL/TP > 1** (realistic risk/reward)
